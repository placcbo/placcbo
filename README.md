# 👋 Hi there, I'm Kevin Ndirangu!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on building fast, scalable, and user-friendly web apps using **React**, **Go**, and **MongoDB**.

## 💼 What I'm Working On

🚀 **Candidly** – A modern, intuitive **resume builder** that helps people craft clean and effective resumes with ease.  
Candidly is all about simplicity and speed — because job seekers deserve tools that just work.

## 🛠️ Tech I Love

### ⚛️ React
- I love React for its **component-based architecture** and how it helps build responsive, dynamic user interfaces with minimal fuss.
- The React ecosystem keeps evolving, and I'm always excited to dive into the latest tools (hello, Hooks and Server Components 👋).

### 🧠 Go (Golang)
- Go is my go-to for building powerful backends. Its simplicity, blazing-fast performance, and built-in concurrency make it perfect for scalable apps and APIs.
- I appreciate how Go encourages writing clean, maintainable code without the bloat.

### 🍃 MongoDB
- Schema-less? Love it.
- MongoDB makes prototyping and scaling data-driven apps a breeze, especially alongside Node or Go.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- **Go Fiber** for high-performance APIs
- Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other devs
